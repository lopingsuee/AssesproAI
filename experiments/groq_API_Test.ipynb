Actually, for the challenges, there are some challenges when I took the certifications, especially for the projects I mentioned that I already working with it. The first one is actually to meet the specific accuracy or validation loss right for the evaluation matrix.\n",
        "And yeah, actually, that's just need to take some trial and error with different architecture. For example, we can try to add more layer, more neurons, changes the neurons, or even I also apply the dropout layer. So yeah, it really helps with the validation loss to become more lower, right?

About transfer learning, we use existing trained models from TensorFlow, for example, like VGG-16, VGG-19, right? Especially for some cases that we need to use deep learning using Keras applications, for example, like image classification, we can use transfer learning models, which is already a trained model with exceptionally high accuracy, high performance. Even though it's trained with different datasets, but it really helps to improve our model performance, model accuracy, model loss. For example, like MobileNet, VGG-19, VGG-16, EfficientNet, it will help to improve our models comparing to the one if we use a traditional CNN model.\n",

The effect is, it will help to improve our accuracy and lower our validation loss by turning off some of the previous layers. For example, we have dense layer 64, and the next layer, we implement the dropout layer with the rate of 0.5, and it will turn off randomly each epoch of the previous dense layer.\n",
